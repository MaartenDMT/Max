# Langchain Upgrade to v0.3.x

## Overview

This document describes the upgrade process for Langchain from an earlier version to v0.3.x. The upgrade includes:

1. Pydantic v1 to v2 migration
2. Integration package restructuring
3. General API changes

## Pre-Migration Analysis

### Python Version Check
The project was already using Python 3.10.14, which is compatible with Langchain v0.3.x.

### Current Langchain Usage
The project was already using Langchain v0.3.x packages:
- `langchain-core>=0.3.75`
- `langchain-community>=0.3.29`
- `langchain-openai>=0.3.32`
- `langchain-ollama>=0.3.7`
- `langchain-anthropic>=0.3.19`
- `langchain-google-genai>=0.1`
- `langchain-text-splitters>=0.3`

## Migration Steps

### 1. Pydantic v1 to v2 Migration
The project was already partially migrated to Pydantic v2:
- No `from langchain_core.pydantic_v1` imports were found
- `@field_validator` was already used instead of `@validator`

### 2. Integration Package Restructuring
The main change was to update imports from `langchain_community.vectorstores` to use `langchain_chroma` directly:
- Updated `ai_tools/ai_doc_webpage_summarizer.py`
- Updated `ai_tools/ai_webpage_research_agent.py`
- Updated `ai_tools/ai_write_assistent/ai_tools.py`

Additionally, `asyncio` imports were added to fix Ruff errors in the modified files.

### 3. General API Changes
The remaining imports from `langchain.` modules were left unchanged as they are still available in the current version:
- `langchain.chains`
- `langchain.chains.summarize`
- `langchain.agents`
- `langchain.tools.retriever`

## Dependency Updates

### pyproject.toml
Added `langchain-chroma>=0.1` to the dependencies.

### requirements.txt
Added `langchain-chroma>=0.1` to the dependencies.

## Testing

Attempts were made to run the existing unit and integration tests, but they failed due to environment issues. Manual testing of critical functionalities was not possible due to missing dependencies in the current environment.

## Lingering Considerations

1. The project should be tested in an environment with all dependencies properly installed to ensure full functionality.
2. The remaining imports from `langchain.` modules may need to be updated in the future if they are deprecated in later versions of Langchain.
3. The `langchain-cli` tool could not be used due to installation issues, so the migration was done manually.

## Conclusion

The Langchain upgrade to v0.3.x has been completed with the necessary code changes and dependency updates. The project should now be compatible with Langchain v0.3.x, but thorough testing in a proper environment is recommended.
