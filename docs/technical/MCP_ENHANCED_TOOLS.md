# MCP-Enhanced System Assistant Tools

This document describes the new Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhanced tools that have been added to the system assistant, providing more comprehensive system monitoring and management capabilities.

## New MCP-Enhanced Commands

The following new commands have been added to the system assistant, leveraging the Context7 MCP approach to provide enhanced system information:

### 1. System Information (`system info`)
Retrieves comprehensive system information including:
- Platform details
- CPU count and usage percentage
- Virtual memory statistics
- Disk usage information
- System boot time
- Active process count

### 2. Network Information (`network info`)
Provides detailed network interface information:
- All network interfaces
- IP addresses assigned to each interface
- Network interface statistics

### 3. Process List (`process list`)
Displays a list of running processes:
- Top 20 processes sorted by CPU usage
- Process ID, name, username
- CPU and memory usage percentages

### 4. Search Processes (`search process <term>`)
Searches for specific processes by name or command line:
- Finds processes matching the search term
- Returns process details for all matches

### 5. Battery Information (`battery info`)
Gets detailed battery status information:
- Battery percentage
- Time remaining estimate
- Power source status (plugged in or battery)

## Implementation Details

These tools enhance the existing system assistant by providing more detailed system monitoring capabilities through the Context7 MCP approach. The implementation uses the existing `psutil` library to gather system information without requiring additional dependencies.

The tools are implemented as asynchronous methods in the `SystemAssistant` class and are registered in the command system through `call_commands.py`.

## Usage Examples

```
# Get comprehensive system information
system info

# Show network configuration
network info

# List running processes
process list

# Search for specific processes
search process python

# Get battery status
battery info
```

## MCP-Enhanced Workflow

A new `MCPEnhancedOrchestratorAgent` has been created that demonstrates how to integrate these MCP-enhanced tools into more complex workflows. This orchestrator can:

1. Use the enhanced system tools to gather detailed context
2. Process and analyze the gathered information
3. Provide meaningful insights based on system state
4. Support troubleshooting and monitoring tasks

The workflow leverages LangGraph for state management and can be extended with additional tools and capabilities.

## Integration with Existing System

These new MCP-enhanced tools integrate seamlessly with the existing system assistant architecture:

1. All new commands are registered in `utils/call_commands.py`
2. Help text has been updated to include the new commands
3. The tools follow the same async API pattern as existing tools
4. Error handling and logging are consistent with existing implementations

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:

1. Additional system monitoring capabilities
2. Integration with external MCP servers for extended context
3. Enhanced data visualization of system metrics
4. Automated system health reporting
5. Proactive system monitoring and alerting
